#  Surprise Housing Case Study - Advance Regression

### Problem Statement

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

<b> Goals of the Case Study </b>
- To model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.
- They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market

Objective: 
- To interpret factors that can help in predicting the housing prices
- How well these factors describe the price.
